    question3(sequence)

Calculates the GC ratio of a DNA sequence.
The GC ratio is the total number of G and C bases divided by the total length of the sequence.
For more info about GC content, see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC-content

Example
≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡

    julia> question3("AATG")
    0.25

    julia> question3("CCCGG")
    1.0

    julia> question3("ATTA")
    0.0
"""

"""
    question4(sequence)

Calculates the GC content of a DNA sequence
and prints it to the screen.

Example

    Sequence:
    AATC
    GC Content:
    0.25
