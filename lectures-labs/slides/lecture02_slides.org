* Reasons to use the terminal
- many bioinformatics tools are only usable via "Command Line Interfaces" (CLIs)
- Many biological file types are enormous and will break your GUI application
- Most “big data” or “-omics” type of analysis must be done on High-performance clusters (HPCs), most of which run headless linux
- Concepts needed for effective terminal use (eg paths) are useful / necessary in all kinds of programming
- It’s fun! (no, really)
- Once you’re over the learning curve, many common tasks are easier
* Terminal gotchas
** Terminal gotcha #1 - no mouse
**Solutions**
- use arrow keys
  + =alt + ←= and =alt + →= (Mac) or =ctrl + ←= and =ctrl + →= (Linux/Windows) can move whole words at a time
- Some useful shortcuts:
- =ctrl + a= : jump to beginning of line
- =ctrl + e= : jump to end of line
- =ctrl + u= : delete from cursor to beginning of line
- =ctrl + k= : delete from cursor to end of line
** Terminal gotcha #2 - less visual
- use =ls=, =pwd=, =git status= etc. frequently to keep track of where you are
- Use =TAB= for completions

* Handy terminal tricks
* Customizing your terminal
