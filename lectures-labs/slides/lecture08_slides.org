* Final Project Details
** Final project: Code + analysis
*** Final Contents
- Code repository with resuable functions (largely built from labs and assignments)
  + including documentation
  + including test suite
- Analysis repository with details, descriptions of code, and plots
- Default project: sequence analysis of Sars-CoV genomes
*** Earlier components
- If proposing alternate project: Analysis proposal
- Analysis plan
- First draft
  + Code, tests, docs should be complete
  + Analysis should be complete
** Dates
*** School Deadlines
- Summer Term Final Projects Due: July 23
- Grades Due: July 30
*** Project Deadlines
- Proposals for alternate projects Due: July 9
- Analysis plans Due: July 12
- First drafts code / notebooks Due: July 16
*** Missing these deadlines will have grading consequences
* Indices vs values
** Confusion between "location" and "thing"
#+begin_src julia
julia> myvec = [1.2, 2.3, 3.4]
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.2
 2.3
 3.4

julia> x = myvec[2]; # 2 is the index

julia> x # this is the value stored at index 2
2.3

** Indices must be integers, values can be anything

* Writing code in notebooks
** Mixing code, results, and descriptions
- can use comments, but they have limited expressiveness
- using "notebook" environments allows including results "inline"
- Many options for notebooks,
  - markdown (R Markdown, Weave.jl)
  - Jupyter notebooks
  - Pluto.jl
** For scientific coding, code is usually ad-hoc
- Can't write unit tests for a specific plot
- But you /can/ for the plot function itself
- Functions, packages, etc, are like "protocols"
- Use code notebooks for "experiments"
* Lab08 == Lab07
** Alignment tracing for NW and SW
- start from $M_(i,j)$ which are
  + the last indices in 1st and 2nd dimension for NW
  + the indices for the matrix with the maximum score in SW
- Check the score from
