## What are "essential" skills?

- How do I think about writing a computer program?
- When the code I've written has an error, what steps do I take to debug it?
- How do I keep track of the code that I've written?
- How do I get help when I'm stuck?

**What are _not_ essential skills:**
- syntax specific to any programming language (even julia!)
- anything that you can google (though knowing *how* to google is!)

## Course Components

- [Zulip chat](https://bonhamlab.zulipchat.com/); all course communication will happen here.
- Free online textbook, [*Think Julia*](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html)
- [BISC 195 course website](http://wellesley-bisc195.github.io)
  - "Lessons" contain additional written content, and links to other components
- Scheduled course times (Tu/F) will be mix of "lecture" and "lab" 
  - Lectures are what we're doing now!
  - Labs will be a mix of activities, pair-programming, and chances to work on assignments
- "Assignments" are due ~ 2 / week, and are the primary source of your grade
  - Submitted / auto graded through [github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/49307558-bisc195-summer2021)
- A "Final Project" will be designed and built in the last 2 weeks of class.

# Lab 1 - Install stuff

In principle, you should have already done this, but life gets busy!
Before we're done here, you should have:

- If you're a windows user, installed WSL2
- installed julia and VS Code
- (optional) Mac users, if you finish other stuff, [install git](http://localhost:8080/lessons/Lesson02/#installing_git)
