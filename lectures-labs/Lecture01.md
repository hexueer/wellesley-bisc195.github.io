## Lab 1 - Install stuff!

In principle, you should have already done this, but life gets busy! Before we're done here, you should have:

- If you're a windows user, installed WSL2
- installed julia and VS Code
- (optional) Mac users, if you finish other stuff, [install git](/lessons/Lesson02/#installing_git)
